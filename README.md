# Kodi-Pi-Project

All of the files uploaded in this repo are Kodi Pi based files. From instructions, to Kodi Repositories I tend to program and work with Raspberry Pi's quite often. They are great for DIY projects and learning code/linux environments; I usualy document all steps required in the processes and then post the instructions here. Enjoy!

EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY, ALWAYS REMEMBER TO MAKE WISE DECISIONS IN THE CYBER WORLD, I HOLD ZERO RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR ACTIONS.
